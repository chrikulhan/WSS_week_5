*Where did JavaScript come from?
*How is it used?
*What does it do?

(*what is the DOM? --the structure such as:
            *which elements contain other elements?)
    -Manipulate the DOM
        *adding elements,
        *removing elements,
        *restructuring elements,
        *changing the attributes of existing elements,
        *changing style or innerHTML
    -Respond to events that happen in your page such as:
        *user resizing window
        *clicking on something
        *user moving the mouse

**the DOM and the response to events can work together to add
 interactivity to your page.

Today:
JavaScript language fundamental review -
    variables, conditional code, functions, loops
JavaScript data structures -
    **arrays (like lists)
    **objects (like dictionaries or a mapping type),
    **JSON--Java Script Object Notation
        **how you create objects in JavaScript
        **also a common way of communicating between two servers.

Install the latest LTS (long term support) version
https://nodejs.org/en/
We'll use it to practice some JavaScript concepts by themselves, without needing to think about HTML too
After installing, restart your editor (VSCode, WebStorm)

NodeJS is a "javascript runtime"
    **it looks at the script and runs the javascript without a browser.
    **when we see servercode, we'll need node.js to run that (in future classes)
