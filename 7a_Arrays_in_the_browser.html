//Arrays in the browser(from powerpoint notes):
/*
    -Student list form, last week's lab
    -In a form, there could be many input errors
    -Use array to make a list of all the problems
    -push adds to the array
    -'join' joins all the errors strings for display
    -Check length property



/*Instead of anticipating all possible problems, you can write
and check all the inputs by pushing the errors into the errors array
and then checking if the errors array is empty or not.

//errors array:
let errors = []

if (!gpa || gpa < 0) || gpa > 4 ) {

//if the errors array is empty, then the form must be valid.
//BUT if the length of the errors array is > 0, then there are errors.
if(errors.length > 0) {
    //tell the user by joining all the error messages together, using
    //the newline character: '\n'
    let errorMsg = errors.join ('\n')
    //and then using an alert to show dialog to the user:
    alert(errorMsg)
    //assume this code is inside an event handler function, so use 'return'
    //would mean stop processing the code.
    return
}
//if there were no errors, you'd start writing code down here.

//Your turn: Tree order form: (see 7ba for the original code and 7bb for the
//working code.

//**Form validation: (video 7, timestamp 7:26)
/* -Why not rely on HTML form validation?
(examples: required values, number validation, min and max value.)
-Not all browsers handle validation attributes in the same way
-For example, Safari doesn't enforce required elements
-HTML form validation is helpful...
    -But JavaScript form validation is not only *more reliable* to the client,
    and more user-friendly, but also more flexible and powerful.

-When we get to servers, we'll talk about why JavaScript validation
is ONLY to be user-friendly, and why you should validate AGAIN
on the server before you save data. It's very very easy to bypass
client-side checks on data
